# graphql-codegen-todomvc

## What is this?
A basic TodoMVC app built using Express, GraphQL, and TypeGraphQL in the backend, and Next.js and React Query with hooks automatically generated by [GraphQL-Codegen](https://www.graphql-code-generator.com/) in the frontend.

The purpose of building this was to become more familiar with TypeGraphQL and GraphQL-Codegen. It's missing a lot of the typical stuff because I just wanted to test out those two packages.

## Getting Started
### Server
```
cd server
yarn
yarn dev
```

### Client
```
cd client
yarn
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the app.

## GraphQL Codegen
All the frontend React Query queries and mutations are generated using `graphql-codegen`. 

Add additional queries and mutations to `/graphql/index.graphql` as necessary, or create new GraphQL files in `/graphql` as desired.

Run codegen
```
cd client
yarn codegen
```
